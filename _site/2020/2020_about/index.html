          Processing Community Day (PCD) is a day to celebrate art, code and diversity held in communities worldwide. Code&Share[&nbsp;&nbsp;] is a community that is born out of PCD @ Aarhus since 2019.<br/>We are a group of software artists, coders, designers and students at Aarhus interested in exploring code and software development beyond its functional aspects. Alongside Processing Community Day, we hold monthly meetups where we make workshops, coding sessions and share our projects with hygge and cake.
