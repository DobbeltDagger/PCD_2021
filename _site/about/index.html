      <p>Processing Community Day (PCD) is a day to celebrate art, code and diversity held in communities worldwide. Code&Share[&nbsp;&nbsp;] is a community that was born out of PCD @Aarhus 2019.</p>
      <p>We are a group of software artists, coders, designers and students at Aarhus University interested in exploring code and software development beyond its functional aspects. Alongside Processing Community Day, we hold monthly meetups where we make workshops, coding sessions and share our projects.</p>

Through studies spanning plants and particles, clouds and computer memory she connects scientific, aesthetic, and speculative perspectives in order to nurture attentiveness to materials and to tell counter-histories. Her work materializes as photographs, weavings, installations, films, artist’s books, and site-specific works in public space. She received her MFA from The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts (2006) and participated in The Whitney Museum’s Independent Study Program, New York (2008-09).

Currently I work as a Postdoc at the project Growing CoDesign hosted by the Dept. of Digital Design and Information Studies at Aarhus University. My research is practice-based and experimental and blends traditional crafts, organic materials and novel sensing technology. I am mainly interested in how digital technologies and creative-aesthetic practices can be applied as a way to reengage with the world we inhabit and build healthy relationships to the nonhumans that make up our life-world. Deeply vested into the pursuit of a more sustainable and live-able world for all of us (human and nonhuman alike), I see the role of design and designers in imagining new and better solutions to how and what things are and how can they be done.</span>
