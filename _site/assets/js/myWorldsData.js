      bio: "<p><b>Honey Biba Beckerlee’s</b> works manifests in a variety of mediums and crafts revolving around experimentation. Her work is research based and draws on quantum mechanics and feminist new-materialism where her materially focused investigations challenge the idea of a coherent objective reality, such as notions of originality, individualism and anthropocentrism. In 2017-2022 she was the recipient of The Novo Nordisk Foundation, PhD Scholarships in artistic practice research between Århus University and The Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Copenhagen.</p>",
      text: "<p>For PCD Honey Beckerlee will present her work with optic fiber and light; a series of art works that takes as their point of departure the submarine cables that form the physical infrastructure for the vast information cloud that makes up the Internet. The works trouble notions of materiality by on the one hand displaying the surprising physical presence of an earthbound digital nervous system of cables submerged in an environment of life at the seabed, while on the other hand investigating the immaterial nature of light. While we often think of code as immaterial, code is tied to a hard drive and never leaves the copper that transmits it, but light can escape its medium since it has no mass. All the data we are constantly generating in our dealings with digital technology is translated into light that dashes through submerged optic fiber...</p>"

The talk will introduce this through our work for the Helsinki Biennial 2023, the Environmental Audiotour that uses creative writing and fiction to create narratives of “environmental data” in urban context of Helsinki.</p>"

Founded in 2009, Studio Richard Vijgen has been evolving into an experimental practice that explores new technologies, interactions and aesthetics to visualize the invisible. Richard Vijgen’s work has been exhibited in and collected by museums and art institutions across the world including Centre Pompidou, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Barbican Gallery, ZKM, Ars Electronica, Vitra Design Museum and Manifesta 12.</p>",
