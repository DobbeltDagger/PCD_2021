reason: 'Coding for me, is a way of expressing yourself just like art and literature. Just like traditional artforms have been used to raise critique and awareness of important matters, I see coding as the new artform that gives empowerment back to the individual. If you are willing to learn how to code, there are endless possibilities to what you can create and explore'
