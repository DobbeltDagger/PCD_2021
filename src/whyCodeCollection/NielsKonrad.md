sortName: 'Konrad'
reason: 'Coming from a visual and creative background and having drawn and sketched for as long as I can remember, I started coding rather late in life. When I started studying deisgn, I remember I saw coding and prototyping with code as a little spark, a little bit of magic that could breathe life into already appealing visual design. Not that static graphic design, print and posters are in anyway boring or will ever go out of fashion, but I thought why not make graphic design react to your presence and make it surprise? Thatâ€™s why I started coding and why I still code today'
