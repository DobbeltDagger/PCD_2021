reason: "Code is often about 'codex' for me, linking laws to books by way of tree trunks. But also ‘code names’ or ciphers, in the sense that this system of signals, or rules that govern their use, means programming (coding, signals and decoding) instead of being programmed by Silicon Valley corporations, through commands, (IP) addresses and data."
