reason: 'Code is often about codex for me, linking laws to books by way of tree trunks. But also ‘code names’ or ciphers, in the sense that this system of signals, or rules that govern their use, which, by channeling German media theorist Friedrich Kittler, means programming (coding, signals and decoding) instead of being programmed by Silicon Valley corporations, through commands, addresses and data. Kittler also stressed that every user should be literate in at least one computer language. I’m still working on that.'
