        <p>Processing Community Day (PCD) is a worldwide event initiated by <a href='https://processingfoundation.org/advocacy/processing-community-day-2020'>The Processing Foundation</a>, involving many international cities to organize a day event with their local communities to celebrating and exploring art, code, and diversity.</p>
        <p>With the backdrop of the ongoing (post)pandemic circumstances, many of us may discover different relations and connections with machines, nature, surrounding worlds, and these have changed our work and play life significantly.</p>

      <div class="Grid-cell">
        <p>With the theme of 'Making Kin' this year, we want to continuously explore a diverse mode of working with code, and further point to how might we maintain and establish (new) connections with one another, both human and nonhuman life forms, and perhaps extending to other species, environments and creatures. We are interested in how machines and code enable us to engage in dialogue with our human and more-than-human kin.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Grid-cell">
        <p>Following this line of inquiry, this year PCD @ Aarhus has chosen to contribute to the public community by putting together podcasts, workshops and talks from diverse practitioners who share different ways of working with humans, machines, and more than human kin artistically and culturally, imagining new ways of connecting the world.</p>

        <p>Processing Community Day (PCD) is a worldwide event initiated by The Processing Foundation, involving more than 30 international cities to organize a day event with their local communities to celebrating and exploring art, code, and diversity.</p>
        <p>Following last year PCD @ Aarhus with the theme to exploring code and coding practice beyond functional applications development, this year we want to keep exposing the diverse mode of working and thinking with/through software. In particular, PCD @ Aarhus 2020 will address the notion of openness and sharing in software ecology, referring broadly to the open/free paradigm for social participation and engagement to create a sustainable community.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Grid-cell">
        <p>Pointing to the ambition of creating an open and sustainable community in Aarhus, our inspiration draws from the free/open-source software movement with which to promote the idea of having the freedom and rights to use, study, create, modify and share software regardless of age, gender, race and class.</p>
        <p>Following this line of thinking, this year we have chosen to contribute to the public community by putting together workshops and talks from diverse practitioners whose share different ways of working with and thinking through software artistically and culturally, opening up our understanding of, and approach to, the software beyond the realms of science and engineering.</p>
