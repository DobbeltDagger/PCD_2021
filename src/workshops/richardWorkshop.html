        <p>Space Weather is the subject of my latest work in a series that explores electromagnetism as a technological medium and a natural phenomenon. In this workshop we will use realtime data from a deep space satellite to create dynamic audiovisual translations.</p>

        <p>BIO: <b>Richard Vijgen</b> Richard Vijgen (1982) is an artist and designer whose work focuses on artistic data visualization. He creates multi-sensorial data experiences that visualize the invisible technological dimensions of reality. His work provides poetical interpretations of data and proposes a dialog between the human perspective and the disembodied world of digital networks, algorithms and wireless communication.</p>
        <p>Founded in 2009, Studio Richard Vijgen has been evolving into an experimental practice that explores new technologies, interactions and aesthetics to visualize the invisible. Richard Vijgenâ€™s work has been exhibited in and collected by museums and art institutions across the world including Centre Pompidou, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Barbican Gallery, ZKM, Ars Electronica, Vitra Design Museum and Manifesta 12.</p>
