        <p>GYOC stores data in the DNA of plants and other living organisms. During our 2 hour workshop participants will have a chance to get familiar with the Grow Your Own Cloud project and understand the science behind. How do we store data in DNA? What is the infrastructure that supports it? Together we will envision potential futures that can arise from Grow Your Own Cloud. We will discuss and design new spaces and interactions that will dictate the future of Organic Data Storage</p>
        <p><i>Registration will soon be available here</i></p>
