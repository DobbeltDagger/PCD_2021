        <h3>Tips for recording</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Device: Any recording equipment is sufficient, even phones.</li>
            <li>Quality: For best sound quality in recording, locate yourself in a room with good sound absorbance (E.g. surround your recording environment with soft items like cushions, carpets or blankets, and opt for a small and quiet room)</li>
            <li>Online interviews: If interviewing through an online connection, you can use the following method for best sound quality:
            <ol>
              <li>Record audio of each person seperately from the online connection. (For instance plug headphones into the computer with the meeting so you can hear the respons from the other person, but record your own voice through e.g. your phone. The other person does the same thing.)</li>
              <li>Collect the two files and mix together the audiotracks during editing.</li>
            </ol>
          </ul>

        <h3>Tips for mixing/editing</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Length: We suggest the length of an episodes to be around 10-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Software: Since openness is at the heart of the processing community, we strongly recommend opting for open source tools for editing (like <a href='https://www.audacityteam.org/' target='_blank'>Audacity</a> or <a href='https://ardour.org/' target='_blank'>Ardour</a>).
            <li>Music: If you feel like it, we’ve coded an instrument for generating music for your podcast episode. <a href='https://editor.p5js.org/mace/sketches/sGLMoweXF' target='_blank'>Go here to use the generator and download the file</a> credits: Mace Ojala</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Use the music for intro, and possibly transitions and outros - whatever suits your case.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Fileformat: Any fileformat can be used, just make it as uncompressed as possible (for exact quality measures, export file at 16 bit and 48 kHz)</li>
            <li>Help: You are welcome to write us an email if you have trouble with the editing (<a href="mailto:margretexie@gmail.com" target='_blank'>margretexie@gmail.com</a>)</li>
