reason: 'Weaving is often associated with the homely, the domestic, and the feminine. Recently, however, the shared history of weaving and computing has been brought to light. Often the binary connection between weaving and computation is exemplified with the 18th century-Jacquard loom, which was operated by punch cards. What happens when the weaving-computing relationship is examined from a bodily and material perspective and when we engage the loom as a computer, as a time machine? Through experiments with coding and weaving I explore the connections between the threads of the loom and the programming of the computer, between the logics of weaving recipes and algorithms.'
