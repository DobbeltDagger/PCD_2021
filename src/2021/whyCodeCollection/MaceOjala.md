reason: 'For me to code is to attend to the relationship we have with these machines, with computers. Basically, to code is to seek a lasting relationship which is based not only on one-sided use, but on mutual transformation. I like to think that coding allows the needs, passions and potentials of both humans and computers to be responded to, and that is a beautiful, worthwhile and even rebellious thing to do.'
