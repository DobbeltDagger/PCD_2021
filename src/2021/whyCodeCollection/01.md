reason: 'The software we use can influence our life in many ways, some we are aware of and some which are hidden. I want to understand the hidden parts as data-tracking, the way in which different softwareâ€™s are programmed and so forth. And in my projects, I try to visualize the hidden parts to try to make people reflect upon them. Therefore, I use coding both to understand and explain the software that we use'
