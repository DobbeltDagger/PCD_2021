sortName: 'Ørum'
reason: 'Why would I not code? Especially when so much of my daily life is shaped wholly or in part by code? From the design of the injection molded plastic chair that my body rest on, to the constant nagging suggestions of my spell checker, I am entangled in code for better or worse. If I want to understand the manmade world around me, and retain some semblance of freedom, I see no way around engaging with code. I remain first and foremost an artist, and as such I work with coding from the point of view of a “script-kiddie” - a dabbling amateur who appropriates and remixes found code without a deep understanding of mathematics or code. A tourist visiting the territory of code and wondering about the conventions and cultures of code without taking up permanent residence or feeling obliged to obey local customs. I mostly use code to break or hack technological artifacts such as routers or screens, in order to make them do things they were not originally intended to do. My hope is to the ludic and weird aspects of contemporary everyday technologies visible behind the pragmatic utilitarianism and normalcy of their usual presentation.'
