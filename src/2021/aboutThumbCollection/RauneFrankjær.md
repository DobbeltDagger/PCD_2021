Currently I’m a Phd fellow at Digital Design and Information Studies at Aarhus University, where I explore mediation of nonhuman / posthuman data, and new ways of applying digital technology blended with traditional crafts and organic materials to expand the boundaries of human perception and connectivity. Deeply vested into the pursuit of a more sustainable and live-able world for all of us (human and nonhuman alike), I see the role of design and designers in imagining new and better solutions to how and what things are and how can they be done' -->
