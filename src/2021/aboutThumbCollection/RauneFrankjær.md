description: "I'm a spatial media designer focusing on digital artefacts, interactive environments and wearable technologies.
Currently I work as a Postdoc at the project Growing CoDesign hosted by the Dept. of Digital Design and Information Studies at Aarhus University. My research is practice-based and experimental and blends traditional crafts, organic materials and novel sensing technology. I am mainly interested in how digital technologies and creative-aesthetic practices can be applied as a way to reengage with the world we inhabit and build healthy relationships to the nonhumans that make up our life-world. Deeply vested into the pursuit of a more sustainable and live-able world for all of us (human and nonhuman alike), I see the role of design and designers in imagining new and better solutions to how and what things are and how can they be done."
