description: 'Nynne Lucca has a Master’s degree in Digital Design from Aarhus University. She is engaged with how we might imagine new, responsible ways of representing data from an intersectional feminist standpoint. To Nynne Lucca, programming can further facilitate this critical exploration of data as it brings forward novel understandings hereof. Something not achieved through an exclusive theoretical engagement. She, therefore, bases her work at the intersection of theory/practice or by “doing-thinking”'
