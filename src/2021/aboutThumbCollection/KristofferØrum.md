Copenhagen, 1975) is an interdisciplinary creature who has produced a long series of demonstrations, acts and wireless transmissions both in and outside of our solar system. Based in a basement, he works in the intersection between daily life and hypothetical digital ecologies.

He believes that all artist’s biographies are works of fiction and should be read as such'
