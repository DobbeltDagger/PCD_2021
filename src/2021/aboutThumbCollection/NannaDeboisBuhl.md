sortName: 'Buhl'
description: 'Nanna Debois Buhl is a Copenhagen-based visual artist whose practice draws connections across time periods and between micro and macro perspectives. Through studies spanning plants and particles, clouds and computer memory she connects scientific, aesthetic, and speculative perspectives in order to nurture attentiveness to materials and to tell counter-histories. Her work materializes as photographs, weavings, installations, films, artist’s books, and site-specific works in public space. She received her MFA from The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts (2006) and participated in The Whitney Museum’s Independent Study Program, New York (2008-09). She is currently a Mads Øvlisen PhD fellow in artistic practice at The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and Copenhagen University'
