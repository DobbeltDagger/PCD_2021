description: 'I am currently studying Digital Design at Aarhus University. Before I attended the course Aesthetic Programming I’ve never had anything to do with code or programming. During this course I realized how a lot of problematic aspects lie underneath the surface of the digital technologies we use in our everyday life, and this is really what made coding interesting to me'
