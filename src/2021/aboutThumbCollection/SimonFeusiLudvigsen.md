description: 'I’m 23 years old, starting my 2nd year as a Digital Design student at Aarhus University. My interest for coding occurred during my second semester while following the course of Aesthetic  Programming. I am specifically interested in how coding in recent times contributes to the illumination of people’s diversities and how the development of this industry moves in a direction that hopefully makes up with the normative, old-fashioned ways of defining individuals (in all sorts of programs)'
