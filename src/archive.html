            <strong>PCD @Aarhus 2021, <em>Making Kin with Machines and Other Worlds</em></strong><br/>
            With the theme of 'Making Kin', we want to continuously explore a diverse mode of working with code, and further point to the way in which we maintain and establish (new) connections with one another, both human and nonhuman life forms, and perhaps extending to other species, environments and creatures. We are interested in how machines and code enable us to engage in dialogues with our human and more-than-human kin.<br/><a href='../2021/2021_index'>Link to PCD @Aarhus 2021 here</a>

            <strong>PCD @Aarhus 2020, <em>Openness in software culture</em></strong><br/>We want to keep exposing the diverse mode of working and thinking with/through software. In particular, PCD @ Aarhus 2020 will address the notion of openness and sharing in software ecology, referring broadly to the open/free paradigm for social participation and engagement to create a sustainable community.<br/><a href='../2020/2020_index'>Link to PCD @Aarhus 2020 here</a>

            <strong>PCD @Aarhus 2019, <em>How to think about code differently</em></strong><br/>For PCD @ Aarhus 2019, we are aiming to build an open and local community to explore code and coding practice in many different ways beyond science and engineering specialisation and functional applications development. Together with each of you from diverse backgrounds, we would like to explore how could we think about code differently and creatively via art, design and beyond.<br/><a href='../2019/2019_index'>Link to PCD @Aarhus 2019 here</a>
