          <strong>PCD @Aarhus 2020, <em>Openness in software culture</em></strong><br/>We want to keep exposing the diverse mode of working and thinking with/through software. In particular, PCD @ Aarhus 2020 will address the notion of openness and sharing in software ecology, referring broadly to the open/free paradigm for social participation and engagement to create a sustainable community.<br/><a href='../2020/2020_index'>Link to PCD @Aarhus 2020 here</a>

          <strong>PCD @Aarhus 2019, <em>How to think about code differently</em></strong><br/>For PCD @ Aarhus 2019, we are aiming to build an open and local community to explore code and coding practice in many different ways beyond science and engineering specialisation and functional applications development. Together with each of you from diverse backgrounds, we would like to explore how could we think about code differently and creatively via art, design and beyond.<br/><a href='../2019/2019_index'>Link to PCD @Aarhus 2019 here</a>
