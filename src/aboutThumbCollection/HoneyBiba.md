description: 'Honey Biba Beckerlee holds a MFA from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, DK and Städelschule, Frankfurt am Main, DE (2008) as well as a MA in Contemporary Art Theory, Goldsmiths College, University of London, UK (2006). Beckerlee is interested in how visual art can challenge the idea of a coherent objective reality, such as notions of originality, individualism and anthropocentrism as well as concepts from classical physics’ such as cause and effect, linear time and objectivity. Her work is research based and draws on quantum mechanics and feminist new-materialism.'
