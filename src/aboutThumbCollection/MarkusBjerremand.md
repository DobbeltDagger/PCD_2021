description: '(He/Him) As a first semester student at the Digital Design masterâ€™s degree programme at Aarhus University, my main area of interest lies within exploring how speculative design practices, such as fictional worldbuilding, might be used as a means of critically inquiring into contemporary data practices, and as a tool for exploring future technology/data imaginaries.'
