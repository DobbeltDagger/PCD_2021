        <p>PCD @ Aarhus is now looking for artists/designers/creative practitioners/computer scientists/amateurs or basically anyone who has an interest in code and would like to show and tell your software-based project. We are aiming at having 15 people for the show and tell session, and each presenter will give a max of 15 mins presentation. The project can be something very simple and fun from basic geometry to complex interactive sketches across disciplines.</p>
