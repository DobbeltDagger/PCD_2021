        <span class="desc">Workshop lead: Renée Ridgway<br/>This workshop will engage with searching online, comparing Google search results to results obtained with alternative search engines (your choice!). The process of gathering data includes saving complete webpages which are then exported as CSV files, extrapolating the URLs to Excel and then using Processing software to visualize diverse ranking and unique hyperlinks (search results). As practices of representation these ‘critical cartographies’ seek to intervene and give shape to the world by making invisible infrastructures more tangible. Bring your laptops and ‘keywords’.<br/>
