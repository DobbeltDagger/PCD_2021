        <span class="desc">GYOC stores data in the DNA of plants and other living organisms. During our 2 hour workshop participants will have a chance to get familiar with the Grow Your Own Cloud project and understand the science behind. How do we store data in DNA? What is the infrastructure that supports it? Together we will envision potential futures that can arise from Grow Your Own Cloud. We will discuss and design new spaces and interactions that will dictate the future of Organic Data Storage<br/><a href="gyoc">Read more about the workshop here</a></span>

        <span class="name">A Visual Introduction To Programming</span>
        <span class="desc">This workshop is for absolute beginners, or people who have only dabbled with programming for fun. The workshop teaches basic concepts in programming through the creation of visual forms. We explore how to build simple drawing systems with the nuts and bolts of code: variables, loops, conditions, branches, and functions. The workshop's two goals are: 1) to demystify and demolish any wrongful preconceptions about programming being a difficult activity, and 2) to highlight the vast creative potential that lies in being able to think and create with code.<br/>
