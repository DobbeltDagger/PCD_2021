          <strong>PCD @Aarhus 2019, <em>How to think about code differently</em></strong><br/>For PCD @ Aarhus 2019, we are aiming to build an open and local community to explore code and coding practice in many different ways beyond science and engineering specialisation and functional applications development. Together with each of you from diverse backgrounds, we would like to explore how could we think about code differently and creatively via art, design and beyond.<br/><a href='../2019/2019_index'>Link to PCD @Aarhus 2019 here</a>
