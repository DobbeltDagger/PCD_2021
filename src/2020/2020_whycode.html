    <span class="whyCode">The software we use can influence our life in many ways, some we are aware of and some which are hidden. I want to understand the hidden parts as data-tracking, the way in which different software’s are programmed and so forth. And in my projects, I try to visualize the hidden parts to try to make people reflect upon them. Therefore, I use coding both to understand and explain the software that we use</span>

    <span class="name">Andreja Andric</span>
    <span class="whyCode">I subscribe to the Pythagorean idea that numbers are behind everything. With this in mind, coding helps me connect to the hidden side of the world and is a form of contemplative action</span>

    <span class="name">Tilde Lageri Damborg</span>
    <span class="whyCode">Coding to me is not only a tool to reach a end goal, its an inspiring, strict, rigid and sometimes very annoying co-designer</span>

  <div class="whyCodeEntry">
    <span class="name">Malthe Stavning Erslev</span>
    <span class="whyCode">I am interested in coding because it inspires me and enables me to think trough conceptual ideas, notions, concerns etc. I will often start out with a vague idea of a concept that I want to explore, and the practice of coding will ‘take’ me somewhere I did not anticipate. I like to remain open and curious as to what reveals itself as being interesting, troubling or surprising when coding. As such, coding is not only a constructive practice for me (where the goal is working software), but is as much a practice of knowledge development. I mostly explore concepts related to words, language and literature, and my practice often results in a rough sketch or proof-of-concept – hence I refer to my practice as ‘conceptual software design’</span>

    <span class="name">Ann Karring</span>
    <span class="whyCode">To me coding is a way to express myself. Whether it is personal or global issues, coding helps me reflect on these issues. I also use it as a tool of communication, so I can share my views with others</span>

  <div class="whyCodeEntry">
    <span class="name">Mark Staun Poulsen</span>
    <span class="whyCode">A year ago, I would have flinched at the mere sight of code. However now, having experienced the potential of computation and creative practices, I highly regard, and seek to understand, the use of code and computation in the art, storytelling and interactive design that I encounter every day. At the same time, code underwrites so many aspects of contemporary digital living – in multifaceted ways. This often makes me cautious and uneasy. It ultimately forces me to consider and reflect on my role as a programmer and the code I can contribute to the rest of the world. Code does matter, and as a student at Digital Design at Aarhus University I have a unique chance to explore meaning and consequences of computation in light of a creative and practical engagement with programming.</span>
